# LED Marquee Parts List

These are some of the parts I used, and some sources for them. If you're planning to buy
any of this stuff, please do your own checking to ensure they are correct and
compatible for your application. I don't control any of the sites that are
linked to here, and I can't guarantee accuracy.

Some links are to Amazon.com. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying

You do **not** need all these things to make an LED Marquee. The minimum for that
is just one or more matrix panels, a controller, and a power supply. I have thrown
everything I can think of in here because sometimes people ask "what is the ...
you used", and I want to answer that comprehensively.
